This is Gleb Ebert's personal R package with functions that he commonly uses.
It is not primarily intended to be used by others and thus support will be limited.
I am happy to fix bugs and implement changes as I see fit, but will not invest time into functionality that I have no use for.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glebrt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("gl-eb/glebrt")
```

## Example

The most commonly used function is to set a global (i.e. for all plots generated by a particular analysis project) ggplot2 theme.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(glebrt)

set_ggplot_theme()
```
